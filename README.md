# Qt_Fractions

This project is a C++ (Widget) application (built using QT framework). It offers a UI to input two rational numbers (fractions) and apply arithmetic and logical operations on the fractions. It makes use of an object-oriented approach with robust exception handling and operator overloading features.
The QT application was built to use shared libraries (all dlls required are contained in the fractions_release.zip file). Download and uncompress the "fractions_release.zip" on the target computer. Double click the "Fractions.exe" and explore the application.
